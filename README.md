# 🏠 House Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on key property features and historical market data.

## 📌 Project Description

This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates house prices using regression techniques. By analyzing factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities, the model provides accurate and data-driven price predictions useful for real estate analysis.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains historical housing data with the following features:

* Location
* Area (Square Footage)
* Number of Bedrooms
* Number of Bathrooms
* Year Built
* Amenities
* Sale Price (Target Variable)

## 🧠 Model Used

Random Forest /DecisionTreeRegressor

The model is trained on historical data and evaluated using standard regression metrics.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iam-huzaifa/Pakistan-House-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Pakistan-House-Price-Prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook or script to train the model and make predictions.

## 📈 Results

The model successfully predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy and demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world real estate problems.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Feature engineering
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Adding more real-world data
